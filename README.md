# BLoc Flutter

From the name itself, Business Logic Component, the BLoC should be able to handle the business which may include, querying the insertion of data to database, retrieval of data from database, and computing numbers. Whatâ€™s important to understand here is: Event-in, State-out. Whatever computations or logical operations that happen inside a BLoC, it should be delivered to the UI components through a State.
